This repository presents several scenarios for using the terminal to perform various tasks.

## Why use a terminal?
Most computers in the world lack a graphical user interface (GUI), and the terminal becomes the main way to interact with the operating system. However, even if you have a GUI, using a terminal can provide some advantages:

### Powerful Tools: 
The terminal provides access to a variety of powerful tools and commands that can help in task automation, data processing and system administration.

### Acceleration of work: 
Thanks to commands and scripts, performing tasks in the terminal can be faster and more efficient, compared to performing similar operations using the graphical interface.

### Remote management: 
The terminal allows you to connect to remote computers via SSH and manage them from the command line, which is especially useful when working with remote servers or in network environments.
